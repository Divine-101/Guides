# Creating Guides

## Designing your Guide

First of all, please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rH9pyS7)!
Discuss your plan(s) with others to preemptively fix errors and make your guide the best version of itself!

Only a few things are required:
1. The name of the file should be PascalCase, meaning the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no spaces (ThisIsInPascalCase).
2. Your name - preferably your discord tag (name + 4 digit discriminator), although any nickname works.
3. If you include any images/gifs/media, the images must be placed in `files` inside a folder with the same name as the guide (PascalCase)
4. Keep language clean (no slurs, insults, etc) and appropriate to being a guide (avoid slang, define acronyms, keep it objective).

A few tips:
1. Keep your guide focused on one specific thing.
2. Know your target audience, and write the guide to them.
3. Use markdown (read how to use markdown [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)) to highlight important information and improve readability.
4. Run your guide through spellcheck.
5. Add images and gifs!

## Making your Guide

To begin with, you will want to [Fork the Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) via the Fork button in the top right of Github.

Then, you want to create a new branch - either through [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) directly, or through the [Github Website](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository), or some other tool, such as [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)

Next, create your guide file (must be a markdown file) and folder in files if you want to add external media.
Once you have done all you want, Commit your changes to the branch.
You then want to Push the branch from your computer out to where it can be accessed by Github.
Once you have made the changes you want, open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to merge your changes from your Branch on your Fork to Divine-Journey-2/Guides.

A brief look will follow to make sure everything follows the rules and lines up, and then it will be merged into the repository!
